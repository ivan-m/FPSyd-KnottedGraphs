What is a graph?
================

Non-graphs
==========

## {id="not-graph-1" data-background="images/plot.png" data-background-size="auto 100%"}

Notes
:   * A plot
    * Visual representation of the relationships between variables

## {id="not-graph-2" data-background="images/chart.png" data-background-size="auto 100%"}

Notes
:   * A chart
    * Any form of graphical representation of data
    * The visualisations of graphs later on are charts.

## {id="not-graph-3" data-background="images/function.png" data-background-size="auto 100%"}

Notes
:   * A graph of a function
    * Usually lazily referred to as "a graph"
    * Makes me squick less than the other types

## {id="not-graph-4" data-background="images/cow.jpg" data-background-size="auto 100%"}

Notes
:   * This is a cow.  It goes "moo".
